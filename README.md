# Patched

A library for reading, writing, and applying [Json patches](https://jsonpatch.com/).

It is a completely specification-compliant implementation, although it does add its own extensions.
See [the differences document](docs/patching/differences.md) for details.

There is documentation [here](docs/index.md) on how the library works, how patching works, and how patches are structured.

## Installing

### For users

This project is mainly intended to be an API for other projects to use.
However, there are [built versions](https://github.com/EnderTurret/Patched/releases) of the library available that include a basic CLI for patching things.

Not only that, but there is a [Minecraft mod](https://github.com/EnderTurret/PatchedMod) that implements patching functionality there.

### For developers

Please see the relevant section in [the API documentation](docs/api/index.md#installation).
